# Sudoku

A simple Sudoku clone.

But to illustrate a bit of React Server Components,
I could implement a multiplayer version using Next.js 13 router handlers.

Like that one from the Rune guys but with Next.js/Vercel instead.
Not sure if it's feasible for realtime, though. But it doesn't have to be.

It could be a turn-based collaborative version.

Maybe I could do Part I/Part II where Part I is the single player version
and Part II is the multiplayer one.

For this one I should probably use the Radix UI components to save time.
